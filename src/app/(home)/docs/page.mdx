# Empire-UI

Beautifully designed AI-powered components. Easy copy-paste. Customizable. Open Source. Built for engineers and designers.

Empire-UI is a project showcasing AI-powered components built with Tailwind CSS. This repository offers a curated collection of reusable components designed to enhance your next AI SaaS website with intelligent, dynamic features and seamless integration.

**The project is currently in beta. The code and styles of the components are subject to change as we continue to refine and improve the collection. We welcome your feedback and contributions to help make this project better.**

### Ready-to-use components

All components are fully documented with examples, ready for implementation and customization across various projects.

### Community contribution

With an open-source approach, EmpireUI strives to build a diverse, free and open collection of animated components.

### Accessible

Ensuring that all components meet high accessibility standards, making them usable for everyone. We are thinking about using radix-ui for each component.
